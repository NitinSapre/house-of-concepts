# Problem statement
In India, every residential society has some amenities like club house, games like table tennis, carrom, pool, etc in playzone, theatre, etc.
Many a times these facilities are crowded with people and residents have to wait for their turn.
This is the problem I would like to solve.

# Solution
Provide a simple facility booking system which will help the residents to book the facilities in advance.
This will help the residents to plan their day and avoid the crowd.

# How
1. Create a simple web application where residents can login and book the facilities.
2. The residents can see the availability of the facilities and book them.

### The application will have 2 types of users:
1. Admin - who can add the facilities, update the availability, etc.
2. Resident - who can book the facilities.
